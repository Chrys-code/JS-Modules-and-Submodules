# JS-Modules-and-Submodules
Introduction to JS modules and sub-modules with Object-Oriented JavaScript

Two short scripts written is JavaScript used to introduce to JsvaScript modules and sub-modules.
Using Module:
  - A short greeting text generator based on given data by the user.
  - ES6 Object Oriented JS (constructor)
  
Using Sub-Modules
  - ES6 Object Oriented JS (constructor)
  - Another short code with three different objects defined as: Box,Circle,Triangle.
  - The Script draws these shapes based on given details by the user on a single canvas.
  - Using aggregated modules. Sub-module scripts are exported, and exported once again
    through the module(canvas.js) to the Index.js.
    However, module(canvas.js) does not import these scripts just pass them to index.js
